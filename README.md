# NETWORK ADMINISTRATION

## Objective

This project centers on identifying and documenting all devices within a lab environment.
Nmap and Wireshark were used to perform detailed network scans, analyze activity, and verify findings directly on the devices. The final report provides a clear overview of the network, demonstrating strong technical ability in network mapping, validation, and documentation.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in identifying and analyzing processes and services across Windows and Linux systems.
- Skilled in configuring virtual machine connectivity to simulate and test diverse network scenarios.
- Advanced capability in capturing and interpreting network traffic using packet sniffing tools such as Wireshark.
- Strong understanding of IPv4 addressing design and network segmentation for optimized performance and security.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
