# NETWORK ADMINISTRATION

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on establishing comprehensive visibility into network assets within a simulated lab environment. Using industry-standard tools such as Nmap and Wireshark, I conducted detailed scans to identify active devices, services, and communication patterns. The project emphasizes the importance of accurate asset inventory as a foundational component of risk management and compliance. Findings were validated through cross-tool analysis, and all discoveries were documented in a structured report that aligns with audit and governance reporting standards. This work reflects core competencies in data verification, documentation integrity, and the ability to translate technical observations into actionable security insights.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project was to identify, verify, and document all devices operating within a virtual lab network.
Using Nmap for active scanning and Wireshark for traffic capture, I collected detailed information on each device’s configuration, services, and communication activity. Each data point was validated through direct examination and cross-referenced between tools to ensure accuracy. The final deliverable was a structured report presenting this information in a format suitable for internal auditing, policy development, and compliance documentation.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in identifying and analyzing processes and services across Windows and Linux systems.
- Configured and managed virtual machines to replicate segmented network environments for realistic risk assessment scenarios.
- Captured and interpreted network traffic to understand communication patterns, detect anomalies, and trace service activity using Wireshark.
- Applied knowledge of IPv4 architecture and subnetting to propose efficient and secure network segmentation.

### Tools Used

- Nmap: For active scanning and device enumeration
- Wireshark: For passive packet capture and protocol analysis
- VirtualBox: For lab environment deployment and simulation scenarios.
